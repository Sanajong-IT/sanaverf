# San-A-Verf Website

A static, responsive website for the San-A-Verf renovation and painting company. The site uses plain HTML augmented with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) via CDN and a small JavaScript file for interactive behavior.

## Project Structure
- `index.html` – Landing page with service highlights and calls to action
- `about.html` – Company background and values
- `services.html` – Detailed list of renovation and painting offerings
- `contact.html` – Contact information and a simple inquiry form
- `assets/` – Images and other static assets
- `script.js` – Handles mobile menu toggling and dynamic footer year

## Getting Started
No build step is required. Clone the repository and open `index.html` in your browser, or serve the files locally:

```bash
# Using Python
python -m http.server 8000
# Using Node (requires npx)
npx serve .
```
Then navigate to `http://localhost:8000`.

## Customization
- Edit the HTML files to change content or structure
- Replace images in the `assets/` directory
- Modify `script.js` to add or adjust interactive behavior
